We have all a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h in the first process.
Second process only takes in the computed values from the first.

1 process for memory select.
1 process each for pipeline stage.

In our data flow diagram we get the value, of the edge.
We have a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h then we calculate which of the three are multiple of 5
and which are multiple of 3.

Probably have a LUT to tell which combos of the three correspond to which
direction.

Steps for the thin line implementation:
	1) Read from file
	2) Read from file --> write to memory
	3) Read from memory
	4) Read from memory --> write to the convolation table

Convolation Table:
	1) Convolulation table is basically a 8 element matrix (3x3 less 1 for
pixel)
	2) We have two for loops for 1-254 for rows and columns
		for row 1 to 254:
			for col 1 to 254:
	3) Then within these we have two more loops to control the location within
the convolulation table.

cur_mem_in_use = 100

	for i = 1 to 254
		rol(cur_mem_in_use, 1)
		for j = 1 to 254
			counter_until_65535++
			if counter_until_65535 has reached 515: <-- this means we are at r2c2
				for m = 0 to 2
					for n = 0 to 2
						table[m,n] = image[i+m-1, j+n-1];
