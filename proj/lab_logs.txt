We have all a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h in the first process.
Second process only takes in the computed values from the first.

1 process for memory select.
1 process each for pipeline stage.

In our data flow diagram we get the value, of the edge.
We have a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h then we calculate which of the three are multiple of 5
and which are multiple of 3.

Probably have a LUT to tell which combos of the three correspond to which
direction.
